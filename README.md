# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This project focuses on the back-end development of WTWR, involving server setup, database integration, API creation, and user authentication.

## Features and Functionality

1. **Express Server**

   - An Express.js server handles incoming requests and responses.

2. **Database Integration**

   - MongoDB database to store and manage clothing items, user information, and interactions.

3. **API Endpoints**
   - RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on clothing items, including features like:
     - Adding new items.
     - Viewing all items.
     - Updating item likes.
     - Deleting items.

## Technologies

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **Express.js**: Framework to simplify building and managing routes and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB integration.
- **Validator.js**: Data validation library for schema constraints.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
